/**
 * Bug: Batch push only wakes 1 waiting worker
 *
 * When pushJobBatch inserts N jobs, it calls shard.notify() only once.
 * This means only 1 of M waiting workers wakes up immediately.
 * The other M-1 workers stay blocked until their timeout expires.
 *
 * Additionally, pendingNotification is a boolean (not a counter),
 * so multiple pushes with no waiters only remember 1 notification.
