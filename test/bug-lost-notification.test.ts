/**
 * Test: Lost Notification TOCTOU Fix Verification
 *
 * Issue: Race condition in pull.ts:185-199
 * Between tryPullFromShard() returning null and waitForJob() being called,
 * a job can be pushed and notify() fired - but no one is waiting yet.
 *
 * Fix: Added pendingNotification flag to Shard:
 * - notify(): if no waiters, set pendingNotification = true
 * - waitForJob(): if pendingNotification, clear it and return immediately
 *
 * This test verifies the fix by:
 * 1. Calling notify() before waitForJob() (simulating the race window)
 * 2. Verifying waitForJob() returns immediately instead of timing out
