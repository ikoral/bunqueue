/**
 * Test: Issue #64 follow-up — Jobs lost from queue when markActive() fails
 *
 * Reproduces the bug: when markActive() throws (e.g. disk I/O error),
 * the job has already been pop()'d from the priority queue in tryPullFromShard()
 * but moveToProcessing() throws before the worker receives the job.
 * The job is LOST from the in-memory queue — subsequent pulls return null.
 *
 * Fix: markActive() is now wrapped in try/catch (non-fatal), and pullJob()
 * has a safety net that requeues the job if moveToProcessing() fails.
