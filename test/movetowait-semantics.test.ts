/**
 * Regression: moveToWait must have the same semantics on embedded and TCP.
 * Previously TCP called promote() (delayed→waiting only) while embedded called
 * moveActiveToWait() (active→waiting) — same method, opposite outcomes.
 * The server handler is now state-dispatched; this embedded test pins the
 * contract. A matching TCP test lives under scripts/tcp/ if needed.
