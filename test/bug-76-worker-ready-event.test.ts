/**
 * Bug #76 - worker event 'ready' does not work anymore
 * https://github.com/egeominotti/bunqueue/issues/76
 *
 * When a Worker is constructed with default options (autorun: true) and the
 * 'ready' listener is attached *after* the constructor returns (e.g. via
 * method chaining), the listener never fires.
 *
 * Root cause: run() is called synchronously inside the constructor and emits
 * 'ready' before the caller has a chance to subscribe.
 *
 * Repro from the issue:
 *   const worker = new Worker('test-wo', (job) => {})
 *     .on('ready', () => console.log('ready!'))
