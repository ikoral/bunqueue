# Frequently Asked Questions

## General

### What is bunqueue?

bunqueue is a high-performance job queue for Bun that uses SQLite for persistence instead of Redis. It provides a BullMQ-compatible API, making migration easy.

### Why SQLite instead of Redis?

- **Simplicity**: No external service to manage
- **Performance**: Bun's native SQLite is incredibly fast
- **Persistence**: Data survives restarts by default
- **Cost**: No Redis hosting costs
- **Portability**: Single file database, easy to backup

### Is bunqueue production-ready?

Yes. bunqueue includes:
- Stall detection for crashed workers
- Dead letter queues for failed jobs
- Automatic retries with backoff
- S3 backups for disaster recovery
- Rate limiting and concurrency control

### What are the system requirements?

- **Bun**: Version 1.0 or higher
- **OS**: macOS, Linux, Windows (WSL)
- **Memory**: Minimum 512MB recommended
- **Disk**: SSD recommended for best performance

## Installation

### Why doesn't it work with Node.js?

bunqueue uses Bun-specific APIs:
- `bun:sqlite` for database access
- `Bun.serve` for HTTP server
- `Bun.listen` for TCP server

These APIs are not available in Node.js.

### How do I install Bun?

```bash
# macOS/Linux
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash

# Windows (PowerShell)
powershell -c "irm bun.sh/install.ps1 | iex"

# Homebrew
brew install oven-sh/bun/bun
```

## Architecture

### What's the difference between embedded and server mode?

**Embedded Mode:**
- Queue runs in the same process as your app
- Best for single-process applications
- No network overhead

**Server Mode:**
- Queue runs as a separate server
- Multiple workers can connect via TCP
- Best for distributed systems

### Can I use both modes together?

No. Each mode uses its own database file. You should choose one mode per deployment.

### How does job persistence work?

Jobs are stored in SQLite with WAL (Write-Ahead Logging) mode:
- Writes are fast and atomic
- Reads don't block writes
- Data survives process crashes
- Automatic checkpointing

## Performance

### How many jobs can bunqueue handle?

On typical hardware (M2 Pro, 16GB RAM):
- **Push**: 125,000 jobs/second
- **Pull**: 100,000 jobs/second
- **Latency**: 0.1-0.5ms p99

### How do I optimize throughput?

1. **Increase concurrency**
   ```typescript
   const worker = new Worker('queue', processor, {
     concurrency: 50
   });
   ```

2. **Use batch operations**
   ```typescript
   await queue.addBulk(jobs);
   await queue.ackBatch(jobIds);
   ```

3. **Enable WAL mode** (default)
   ```bash
   sqlite3 queue.db "PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL;"
   ```

### Why are my jobs slow?

Common causes:
- Low concurrency setting
- Slow job processor function
- Database on HDD instead of SSD
- Too many indexes

## Job Processing

### What happens if a worker crashes?

With stall detection enabled:
1. Worker misses heartbeat
2. Job is marked as stalled
3. Job is retried automatically
4. If max stalls exceeded, sent to DLQ

### How do retries work?

```typescript
await queue.add('task', data, {
  attempts: 5,        // Max attempts
  backoff: 1000       // Base delay in ms (doubles each retry)
});
```

Retry delays: 1s → 2s → 4s → 8s → 16s

### What is the Dead Letter Queue?

The DLQ stores jobs that:
- Exceeded max retry attempts
- Had unrecoverable errors
- Exceeded max stalls

You can inspect, retry, or purge DLQ jobs.

### Can I process jobs in order?

Yes, use LIFO mode:
```typescript
await queue.add('task', data, { lifo: true });
```

Or use priority:
```typescript
await queue.add('high', data, { priority: 10 });
await queue.add('low', data, { priority: 1 });
```

## Scaling

### Can I run multiple workers?

Yes. In server mode, multiple workers can connect:

```typescript
// Worker 1
const worker1 = new Worker('queue', processor);

// Worker 2 (different process/machine)
const worker2 = new Worker('queue', processor);
```

### Does bunqueue support clustering?

Not built-in. For high availability:
1. Use S3 backups for failover
2. Run read replicas with SQLite replication
3. Use load balancer for multiple servers

### How do I handle high load?

1. **Horizontal scaling**: Add more workers
2. **Rate limiting**: Protect downstream services
3. **Priority queues**: Process important jobs first
4. **Batch processing**: Reduce overhead

## Data & Backup

### Where is data stored?

Default: `./data/bunq.db`

Configure with:
```bash
DATA_PATH=./data/production.db bunqueue start
```

### How do I backup the database?

**Option 1: S3 Automatic Backup**
```bash
S3_BACKUP_ENABLED=1 \
S3_BUCKET=my-bucket \
S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID=xxx \
S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=xxx \
bunqueue start
```

**Option 2: Manual Backup**
```bash
sqlite3 queue.db ".backup backup.db"
```

### How do I restore from backup?

```bash
bunqueue backup list
bunqueue backup restore backups/2024-01-15/queue.db --force
```

## Troubleshooting

### "SQLITE_BUSY: database is locked"

Multiple writers are conflicting. Solutions:
1. Use server mode for multi-process
2. Ensure only one embedded instance
3. Check for stale lock files

### "Job not found"

The job was already:
- Completed and removed (`removeOnComplete: true`)
- Failed and removed (`removeOnFail: true`)
- Manually deleted

### High memory usage

Common causes:
1. Too many jobs in memory
2. DLQ accumulating failed jobs
3. Job data is too large

Solutions:
```typescript
// Remove completed jobs
await queue.add('task', data, { removeOnComplete: true });

// Purge old DLQ entries
queue.purgeDlq();

// Clean old jobs
queue.clean(3600000); // 1 hour
```

## Migration

### Can I migrate from BullMQ?

Yes. See the [Migration Guide](/bunqueue/guide/migration/).

Key differences:
- No Redis connection needed
- Backoff is simplified
- Rate limiting is on queue, not worker

### Can I migrate from other queues?

bunqueue uses a standard job format. Export your jobs as JSON and use:

```typescript
const jobs = loadJobsFromOldQueue();
await queue.addBulk(jobs.map(j => ({
  name: j.type,
  data: j.payload,
  opts: { priority: j.priority }
})));
```
