# CLI Commands

bunqueue includes a powerful CLI for server management and job operations. The CLI works in two modes:

- **Server mode**: Start the bunqueue server
- **Client mode**: Send commands to a running server

## Getting Started

### Start the Server

```bash
# Start with defaults (TCP: 6789, HTTP: 6790)
bunqueue start

# Custom ports
bunqueue start --tcp-port 7000 --http-port 7001

# With persistent storage
bunqueue start --data-path ./data/production.db

# With authentication
AUTH_TOKENS=secret-token bunqueue start
```

**Output:**
```
bunqueue v1.6.0
TCP server listening on port 6789
HTTP server listening on port 6790
Database: ./data/bunq.db
```

### Connect to Server

All client commands connect to a running server:

```bash
# Default connection (localhost:6789)
bunqueue stats

# Connect to remote server
bunqueue stats --host 192.168.1.100 --port 6789

# With authentication
bunqueue stats --token secret-token
```

---

## Core Operations

### Push Jobs

Add jobs to a queue for processing.

```bash
# Basic push
bunqueue push emails '{"to":"user@example.com","subject":"Welcome"}'
```

**Output:**
```
Job pushed successfully
ID: 1001
Queue: emails
Priority: 0
```

```bash
# With priority (higher = processed first)
bunqueue push emails '{"to":"vip@example.com"}' --priority 10
```

**Output:**
```
Job pushed successfully
ID: 1002
Queue: emails
Priority: 10
```

```bash
# Delayed job (process after 5 seconds)
bunqueue push notifications '{"message":"Reminder"}' --delay 5000
```

**Output:**
```
Job pushed successfully
ID: 1003
Queue: notifications
State: delayed
Run at: 2024-01-15T10:30:05.000Z
```

```bash
# With custom job ID
bunqueue push orders '{"orderId":"ORD-123"}' --job-id order-ORD-123
```

### Pull Jobs

Retrieve jobs for processing (typically used by workers).

```bash
# Pull next job
bunqueue pull emails
```

**Output:**
```json
{
  "id": "1001",
  "name": "default",
  "data": {"to":"user@example.com","subject":"Welcome"},
  "priority": 0,
  "attempts": 0,
  "timestamp": 1704067200000
}
```

```bash
# Pull with timeout (wait up to 5s for job)
bunqueue pull emails --timeout 5000
```

```bash
# Pull returns null if queue is empty
bunqueue pull empty-queue
```

**Output:**
```
No jobs available
```

### Acknowledge Jobs

Mark jobs as completed after successful processing.

```bash
# Simple acknowledgment
bunqueue ack 1001
```

**Output:**
```
Job 1001 acknowledged
State: completed
```

```bash
# With result data
bunqueue ack 1001 --result '{"messageId":"msg-abc123","delivered":true}'
```

**Output:**
```
Job 1001 acknowledged
State: completed
Result: {"messageId":"msg-abc123","delivered":true}
```

### Fail Jobs

Mark jobs as failed (will retry if attempts remaining).

```bash
# Mark as failed
bunqueue fail 1001 --error "SMTP connection timeout"
```

**Output:**
```
Job 1001 marked as failed
Error: SMTP connection timeout
Attempts: 1/3
Next retry: 2024-01-15T10:31:00.000Z
```

```bash
# Job moved to DLQ after max attempts
bunqueue fail 1001 --error "Permanent failure"
```

**Output:**
```
Job 1001 marked as failed
Error: Permanent failure
Attempts: 3/3
Status: Moved to DLQ
```

## Common Workflows

### Process Jobs Manually

```bash
# 1. Pull a job
JOB=$(bunqueue pull emails --json)
JOB_ID=$(echo $JOB | jq -r '.id')

# 2. Process it (your logic here)
echo "Processing job $JOB_ID..."

# 3. Acknowledge or fail
bunqueue ack $JOB_ID --result '{"processed":true}'
```

### Monitor Queue Health

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# monitor.sh - Alert if queue backlog grows

THRESHOLD=1000
WAITING=$(bunqueue queue jobs emails --state waiting --json | jq 'length')

if [ "$WAITING" -gt "$THRESHOLD" ]; then
  echo "ALERT: emails queue has $WAITING waiting jobs"
  # Send notification...
fi
```

### Scheduled Maintenance

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# maintenance.sh - Daily cleanup

# Clean old completed jobs (older than 24h)
bunqueue queue clean emails --grace 86400000 --state completed
bunqueue queue clean notifications --grace 86400000 --state completed

# Purge old DLQ entries
bunqueue dlq purge emails

# Create backup
bunqueue backup now
```
